### Shared representation and persistence in neural network architectures using RNNs

Representation learning interacts with task switching. The study by Musslick and Cohen (2017) could show by using neural network simulations that the more a shared representation of a previously executed task persists in time, the more it interferes with a subsequent task. They state that “[...] persistence in neural networks is typically implemented in the form of recurrent connections between the processing units. Here, we chose, for simplicity, to implement persistence by explicitly integrating processed information over time.” With this project we aim to replicate their findings using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
